This is my graduate project which taking about one nonparametric regression method acting on mixed high dimensional data, including functional, continuous and categorical data: kernel smoothing method. This method is somehow basic unsupervised method which can be used on machine learning.

The experiment is based on HCI HAR dataset where they detecting human behaviour by receiving signal from phones. The theoritical part is from research.

The code here is some basic idea and the subfile is the final code and you can just download that one. Please ignore the plot and calculating accuracy data file, these are rubbish idea during brainstorm.

I hope this project helps you well.
